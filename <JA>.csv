The Phoenix, AN/TSC-156 terminal, is a transportable multichannel-tactical-satellite-communications terminal operating in the Super High Frequency band. Its mission is to provide flexible, mobile, high capacity, extended-range communications connectivity using military and commercial satellite space segments. The Phoenix may interface with other strategic networks via standardized tactical entry points or strategic assets.rThe Army has a requirement to provide six (6) AN/TSC-156D terminals to the European theaters Army Pre-position Stock (APS) to support the European Reassurance Initiative (ERI). The APS will support contingency operations as required. Since the Phoenix terminal is out of production, Product Manager, Satellite Communications (PdM SATCOM) had to find another approach to meet this requirement, which is to upgrade terminals that were previously fielded to the United States Marine Corps (USMC).rThe Government previously fielded thirty-five (35) AN/TSC-156C terminals to the USMC, which are not the same configuration as the AN/TSC-156D terminal. The USMC is turning in all thirty-five (35) terminals and the Army is taking possession of these terminals.rThis new contract will require the contractor to test the six (6) AN/TSC-156C terminals and then upgrade the terminals to the AN/TSC-156D with Replacement Frequency Modulation Orderwire (RFMOW)/Windows 7 configuration. The contractor is also required to conduct a post test after the upgrade.",0822,"Kevin O. Andralliski, Phone 4438614988, Email kevin.o.andralliski.civ@mail.mil",
