Description: Headquarters Marine Corps (HQMC), Deputy Commandant, Installations and Logistics (DC IL) Expeditionary Logistics Division requires support for the training, equipment, online resource development and community facilitation support for the Marine Maker Initiative. This initiative began in 2016, as part of the 2015 Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV) Implementation Plan for Additive Manufacturing. This particular initiative focuses on workforce development of digital design and manufacturing technologies. This contract provides support to the Marine Maker Initiative, and is intended to enable Marines with the training and tools necessary to better develop tactical solutions to problems. This initiative includes four different types of training in various locations both CONUS and OCONUS, online training and resource development, refinement of the digital collaboration website, and purchasing of equipment to include 3D Manufacturing Kits, Fabrication Kits, Robotics Kits, and Electronics Kits. The performance period for this contract has a one-year base period with two (2) one-year option periods.r17. Place of Contract Performance: Performance will be at the Contractors Facilities. Travel is required to support the training events held at DoD Facilities both CONUS / OCONUS. 18. Set-Aside Status: This is a sole-source direct award to a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) IAW FAR 19.1406 and FAR 6.302-5(b)(6).19. Rationale for Small Business strategy: After reviewing the results of a Market Survey, MCICOM identified one SDVOSB capable of fulfilling the requirement in its entirety. FAR 19.203(c) states that the contracting officer shall first consider an acquisition for the small business socioeconomic contracting programs before considering a small business set-aside. This is further echoed in FAR 19.1406 (a), which states that a contracting officer shall consider a contract award to an SDVOSB concern on a sole source basis before considering small business set-asides.While there are other small businesses that may be interested in fulfilling this requirement, in accordance with FAR 19.203 (Relationship Among Small Business Programs), there is no order of preference among the various socioeconomic contracting programs. The Government should consider the market research and agency progress in fulfilling small business goals in making its decision on which program to utilize. The Government has taken both of those aspects into consideration in its decision to utilize the authority prescribed at FAR 19.1406 to contract directly with an SDVOSB for this requirement. The Small Business Specialist concurred with this determination on 22 June 2017.",,,,"$3,955,263.31",701 S Courthouse Rd Arlington VA 22204-2461,0829
