Naval Sea Systems Command will\ninitiate appropriate security clearance action for any apparent successful Offeror which does not\nalready possess such clearance. The Government is not obligated to delay award pending security\nclearance of any Offeror.\n\n(b) The security classification of this procurement is specified in the Contract Security\nClassification Specification, DD Form 254, attached hereto.\n\n* The DD 254 is provided as Attachment 1 with this solicitation.\n\nHQ L-2-0005 NOTIFICATION OF POTENTIAL ORGANIZATIONAL CONFLICT(S) OF\nINTEREST (NAVSEA) (JUN 1994)\n\n(a) Offerors are reminded that certain existing contractual arrangements may preclude, restrict or\nlimit participation, in whole or in part, as either a subcontractor or as a prime contractor under\nthis competitive procurement. Of primary concern are those contractual arrangements in which\nthe Offeror provides support to PEO IWS 4.0 in support of operation of the office or any of its\nprograms. General guidance may be found in FAR 9.505; however, this guidance is not all\ninclusive. The Offeror\'s attention is directed to the "Organizational Conflict of Interest" (or\nsimilar) requirement which may be contained in current or completed contract(s) which prohibits\nthe prime or subcontractor from providing certain supplies or services to the Government as\ndescribed above during the period of the current "support" contract(s) or for a period after\ncompletion of the "support" contract(s). Notwithstanding the existence or non-existence of an\nOrganizational Conflict of Interest (OCI) clause or similar requirement in current or completed\ncontract(s), the Offeror shall comply with FAR 9.5 and identify whether an OCI exists and not\nrely solely on the presence of an OCI requirement.\n\n(b) If a potential conflict of interest exists at any tier, each potential prime Offeror is requested to\nnotify the Contracting Officer within 14 days of the date of this solicitation. The Offeror shall\nprovide: (1) the contract number and name and phone number of the Contracting Officer for the\ncontract which gives rise to a potential organizational conflict of interest; (2) a copy of the\nrequirement; (3) the statement of work (or technical instruction) from the existing contract; (4) a\nbrief description of the type of work to be performed by each subcontractor under the\ncompetitive procurement; and (5) any additional information the Contracting Officer should\nconsider in making a determination of whether a conflict of interest exists. The Government may\nindependently verify the information received from the Offeror. Notwithstanding the above, the\nGovernment reserves the right to determine whether a conflict of interest exists based on any\ninformation received from any source.\n\n(c) The Government will notify an Offeror of any conflict of interest within 14 days of receipt of\nall required information. Those Offerors deemed to have a conflict of interest may be ineligible for\naward. Failure to provide the information in a timely manner does not waive the Government\'s\nrights to make a conflict of interest determination. The Offeror is notified that if it expends time\nand money on proposal preparation, such expenditure is at its own risk that the Government will\nnot determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists.\n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 45 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\nhttp://farsite.hill.af.mil/VFNAPSa.htm\nhttps://www.acquisition.gov/far\n\n\n(d) Any potential prime contractor which proposes a subcontractor later determined to have a\nconflict of interest and deemed ineligible to participate in the current competition, may not be\ngranted the opportunity to revise its proposal to remove the ineligible subcontractor. The\nGovernment reserves the right to determine which Offerors remain in the competitive range\nthrough the normal source selection process.\n\n(e) If the Offeror determines that a potential organizational conflict of interest does not exist at\nany tier, the Offeror shall include a statement to that effect in its response to this solicitation.\n\nHQ L-2-0008 REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING WORK WEEK (NAVSEA) (MAY 1993)\n\n(a) Uncompensated effort is defined as hours provided by personnel in excess of 40 hours per\nweek without additional compensation for such excess work.\n\n(b) The offeror may include uncompensated effort in its proposed level of effort if:\n\n(1) The offeror has an established cost accounting system, approved by the Defense Contract\nAudit Agency, which records all hours worked, including uncompensated hours, for all\nemployees, and regardless of contract type.\n\n(2) Uncompensated hours, for all employees and regardless of contract type, are included in the\nofferor\'s base for allocation of overhead costs.\n\n(3) The proposal identifies hours of uncompensated effort proposed by labor category.\n\n(4) The proposal identifies the amount of uncompensated effort which will be performed without\nsupervision and without support personnel and assesses the productivity of such effort.\n\n(5) The proposal describes the extent to which employees are required or encouraged to perform\nuncompensated effort and the impact the use of uncompensated effort has on work effectiveness.\n\n(6) The proposal includes a copy of the corporate policy addressing uncompensated effort.\n\n(c) The above information must be provided for each subcontract which has uncompensated\neffort included in the proposed level of effort.\n\n(d) Any proposal which includes uncompensated effort in the proposed level of effort not in\ncompliance with the above may be rejected.\n\nHQ-L-2-0010 SUBSTITUTION OF PREVIOUSLY APPROVED SINGLE PROCESS\nINITIATIVE (NAVSEA) (MAY 1998)\n\nYour proposal shall identify where you are substituting your previously approved Single Process\nInitiative (SPI) processes for specified requirements.

The\nGovernment intends to award one task order as detailed in Section M.\n \nOfferors may submit questions requesting clarification of solicitation requirements via SeaPort.\nThe Government requests all questions be submitted by 4:30 PM EST within 10 business days\n\nfrom date of solicitation release. Questions received after the 10th business day might not be\nanswered as time may not permit responses to questions received after that time.\n \nTHE GOVERNMENT RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REJECT ANY PROPOSAL THAT DOES\nNOT COMPLY WITH THESE PROPOSAL PREPARATION/SUBMISSION\nINSTRUCTIONS.\n \n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 51 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\nDue to the nature and scope of the work encompassed by this solicitation, the Government\nrequires that there be no conflict which would preclude the prime contractor from performing any\nportion of the Statement of Work, regardless of whether it intends to subcontract that portion. \nDue to the nature of the work outlined in Section C, the Government anticipates that\norganizational conflicts of interest (OCIs), including impaired objectivity OCIs, will arise for\nOfferors that perform under other contracts within the cognizance of PEO IWS 6.0 as prime\ncontractor or subcontractor for hardware, software, system design, integration, or production of\nthe systems that will be covered by this solicitation. (See Attachment 10, PEO IWS 6.0 Industry\nPartners) The Government is most concerned about potential OCIs in the following scenarios:\n \n(1) when a contractors work under one Government contract could entail its evaluating itself or a\nrelated entity, either through an assessment of performance under another contract or an\nevaluation of proposals (impaired objectivity OCIs); (2) when performance of the all of the work\nunder this solicitation would place an Offeror in a position to make technical, design, or\nprogrammatic recommendations that would include hardware, software, system design,\nintegration, or production of systems provided by the Offerors organization; or (3) when the\nprovision of the engineering and technical direction described in Section C and L would create the\nsituation prohibited by FAR 9.505-1 because the Offeror is currently a prime contractor,\nsubcontractor, or consultant on a contract for the supply of a system covered by this solicitation\nor any of its major components.\n \nTherefore, if any Offeror may have an OCI, or if any Offeror has taken any steps to eliminate an\nOCI and the Offeror believes that the conflict no longer exists, the Offeror must notify the\nGovernment and must submit an OCI mitigation plan with its proposal. Failure by an Offeror\nthat has identified a potential OCI or an eliminated OCI to submit an OCI mitigation plan with\nits proposal shall be considered grounds for disqualification from award. The Government will\nnot accept mitigation measures for impaired objectivity OCIs. For any OCI, the Government will\nnot accept mitigation or elimination measures: (1) that create an additional burden on the\ngovernment to implement; (2) that involve directed subcontractors or creating separate lines of\nreporting or any modification to the Government/prime contractor relationship; or (3) that are\ndeemed in the sole discretion of the contracting officer to provide insufficient organizational\nindependence between the prime contractor or a subcontractor under this contract and a prime\ncontractor or subcontractor for hardware, software, system design, integration, or production of\nthe systems that will be covered by this solicitation.\n \nThis is not an exhaustive list of measures that will be considered inadequate to protect the\nGovernment. It is an illustrative list provided in an effort to ensure that all Offerors understand\nthe Governments expectations and intent to avoid OCIs. The Government reserves the right to\ndetermine whether or not any mitigation plan provided by an Offeror is sufficient to protect the\nGovernment. The Government also does not intend to accept any mitigation measures that\ninvolve additional oversight or commitment of resources by the Government, such as agency\nreview of contractor deliverables, internal review of task assignments for OCI before issuance, or\nformalized monthly reviews of work performed and projected.

SeaPort-E Prime Contractors that elect to propose Large Business\nsubcontractors that are not members of their respective teams are required to provide written\njustification with their proposal submission as to why the use of Large Business non-team\nmembers is necessary to their accomplishment of the solicitation requirements. Further,\nSeaPort-E Prime Contractors are required to explain how their use of Large Business non-team\nmembers does not negatively impact the competitive aspects of the procurement. Upon review\nof said justification, the Government reserves the right to declare SeaPort-E Prime Contractors\nineligible for award if their proposing of Large Business non-team members is considered to be\nunjustified or injurious to the competitive aspects of the procurement.\n \nIn accordance with the basic SeaPort contract clause H.7 SUBSTITUTION OF TEAM\nMEMBERS AND SUBSTITUTION OF PERSONNEL, the Contractor may not add or delete\nany team member from the team without approval by the SeaPort Contracting Officer.

Offeror\'s proposal should represent its best efforts to respond to the solicitation. Any\ninconsistency between promised performance, the technical capability and experience in the\nproposal, identified personnel resources, and cost/price must be explained in the proposal. For\nexample, if the intended use of new and innovative techniques is the basis for an abnormally low\nestimate, the nature of these techniques and their impact on cost or price shall be explained; or, if\na corporate policy decision has been made to absorb a portion of the estimated cost/price, that\nmust be stated in the proposal. Any inconsistency, if unexplained, may raise a fundamental\nquestion of the Offerors understanding of the nature and scope of the work required and may\nadversely impact the evaluation of the Offerors proposal. The burden of proof as to cost/price\ncredibility rests with the Offeror. Unrealistically low prices may indicate an inability to\nunderstand requirements and a high-risk approach to contract performance. Accordingly, the\nGovernment may consider the findings of such an analysis in evaluating an Offerors ability to\nperform and the risk of its approach.\n \n4.4.2 SECTION 2- Cost/Price Data (Prime Offerors)\n \na. Offerors shall provide Supporting Cost/Price Data using the format provided as Attachment 7\n(Cost Summary Format) with this solicitation.

The Government intends to evaluate proposals and award the Task Order upon initial\nproposals. Therefore, the Offerors initial proposal should contain the Offerors best terms from\na cost or price and technical standpoint. However, in accordance with clause H-5 of the basic\nIDIQ contract, the Government may contact any or all or a limited number of awardees with\nquestions concerning their responses as permitted under FAR Part 16.\n \n1.0 BASIS FOR AWARD\n \na. The following conditions must be met in order to be eligible for award:\n \n\n(1) The proposal must comply in all material respects with the requirements of the law,\nregulation and conditions set forth in this solicitation and in the SeaPort-e basic IDIQ contract,\n \n\n(2) The proposal must meet all solicitation requirements.\n \nb. The Government anticipates a single Task Order award resulting from this solicitation.\nHowever, the Government reserves the right to award more than one or no task order, depending\non the quality of the proposals received and the availability of funds. The Government also\nreserves the right to make an award without discussions.\n \nc. The award decision will be determined based on the Governments evaluation of each\nOfferors complete proposal against the evaluation factors and subfactors identified below.\nAward will be made to the Offeror whose proposal demonstrates the best overall value to the\nGovernment based on the factors and subfactors described herein. Best value means the expected\noutcome of an acquisition that, in the Governments estimation, provides the greatest overall\nbenefit in response to the requirement (FAR 2.101). In making this decision, the Government is\nmore concerned with obtaining offers demonstrating superior technical merit based on the\nnon-cost factors at a reasonable cost or price than with making an award to the Offeror with the\nlowest proposed cost/price. Accordingly, the Government may be willing to pay a reasonable\npremium for a contract offering superior technical merit.\n \nd. In order to select the successful Offeror, the Government will compare Offeror proposals.\nThe comparison will trade off differences in technical merit based on the non-cost factors and\nTotal Evaluated Cost (TEC). If one Offeror has both the better technical merit or capability and\nthe lower TEC, then that Offeror will be the better value. If one Offeror has the better technical\nmerit or capability and a higher TEC, the Government will decide whether the difference in\ntechnical merit/capability is worth the difference in TEC. If it is determined that the difference in\ntechnical merit/capability is worth the difference in TEC, then the more capable, higher-priced\nOfferor will be the better value. If not, then the less capable, lower-priced Offeror will be the\nbetter value. A TEC will not be developed and best value analysis will not be performed for any\nOfferors who are unacceptable or unsatisfactory in any factor or subfactor and award will not be\nmade to any Offeror who is unacceptable or unsatisfactory in any factor or subfactor.\n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 68 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\n \nNote 1: Awards will only be made to an Offeror that has no organizational conflict of interest as\ndefined in FAR 9.5 or that the Government determines has provided a satisfactory mitigation plan.\nOfferors are advised that technical proposals may be evaluated without consideration of any\nproposed subcontractor which is deemed to have an organizational conflict of interest and for\nwhich an unsatisfactory mitigation plan has been proposed.\n \n2.0 Evaluation Factors and Subfactors:\n \n2.1 Application of Factors and Subfactors\n \na. General. The Government will apply evaluation factors and subfactors to identify the best\nvalue proposal. The evaluation factors and subfactors represent key areas of importance to be\nconsidered in the source selection decision. The factors, subfactors, and associated elements have\nbeen chosen to support meaningful discrimination between and among competing proposals. As\ndemonstrated in their proposals, prospective Offerors shall be evaluated in terms of their ability\nto meet or exceed the programs requirements stated in the Statement of Work (SOW). Proposals\nshall be evaluated in accordance with the factors and subfactors described in paragraph 2.2 below.\n \nb. Relative Importance. The following table indicates all significant factors and significant\nsubfactors that will be considered in awarding the Task Order. The relative importance of the\nevaluation factors and subfactors contained in the RFP reflects the overall requirements of this\nacquisition as outlined in the SOW.\n \n\nFactors Subfactors\n \n\n1. Technical Capability and Experience Technical Capabilities and ExperienceA.\n\n Key PersonnelB.\n\n Staffing PlanC.\n\n Management PlanD.\n\n \n\n2. Past Performance None\n\n \n\n3. Total Evaluated Cost None\n\n \nThe evaluation factors are divided into two categories, Technical Capability and Experience/Past\nPerformance and Total Evaluated Cost (TEC). The Technical Capability and Experience/Past\nPerformance evaluation will consider the areas identified in Factors 1 and 2 above.

Under the Technical Capability/Past Performance evaluation factors,\nTechnical Capability is more important than Past Performance. Technical Capability and\nExperience/Past Performance is significantly more important than the Total Evaluated Cost;\nhowever, as competing proposals approach Technical Capability/Past Performance equality, the\ntotal evaluated cost will increase in importance.\n \nc. Adjectival Ratings. The Government will perform an evaluation of the Technical Capability\nand Past Performance evaluation factors and subfactors based on the Offerors proposal. This\nevaluation focuses on strengths and weaknesses of the Offerors proposal, resulting in the\nassignment of an adjectival rating for each factor and subfactor. Cost/Price will not be assigned an\nadjectival rating.\n \nNote: The following adjectival ratings/definitions shall be used for the Technical Capability\nand Experience evaluation factors and subfactors:\n \nOutstanding: An outstanding proposal is characterized as follows:\n \nProposal meets requirements and indicates an exceptional approach and understanding of the\nrequirements. Strengths far outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful contract performance\nis very low.\n \nVery Good: A very good proposal is characterized as follows:\n \nProposal meets the requirements and indicates a thorough approach and understanding of the\nrequirements. Proposal contains strengths which outweigh any weaknesses. Risk of unsuccessful\ncontract performance is low.\n \nAcceptable: An acceptable proposal is characterized as follows:\n \nProposal meets the requirements and indicates an adequate approach and understanding of the\nrequirements. Strengths and weaknesses are offsetting or will have little or no impact on contract\nperformance. Risk of unsuccessful contract performance is low.\n \nMarginal: A marginal proposal is characterized as follows:\n \nProposal does not clearly meet the requirements and has not demonstrated an adequate approach\nand understanding of the requirements. The proposal has one or more major weaknesses that are\nnot offset by strengths. Risk of unsuccessful contract performance is high.\n \nUnacceptable: An unacceptable proposal is characterized as follows:\n \nProposal does not meet the requirements and contains one or more deficiencies. The proposal is\n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 70 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\nunawardable.\n \nWeakness is defined as a flaw in the proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful contract\nperformance. A significant weakness in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the\nrisk of unsuccessful performance.\n \nSignificant Weakness in the proposal is a flaw that appreciably increases the risk of\nunsuccessful contract performance.\n \nDeficiency is defined as a material failure of a proposal to meet a Government requirement or a\ncombination of significant weaknesses in a proposal that increases the risk of unsuccessful\ncontract performance to an unacceptable level.\n \nRisk, is the potential for unsuccessful contract performance. The consideration of risk assesses\nthe degree to which an Offerors proposed approach to achieving the technical factor or subfactor\nmay involve risk of disruption of schedule, increased cost or degradation of performance, the\nneed for increased Government oversight, and the likelihood of unsuccessful contract\nperformance. (For firm-fixed-price contracts, the reference to increased cost may be removed\nfrom the risk definition.)\n \nStrength is an aspect of an Offerors proposal that has merit or exceeds specified performance or\ncapability requirements in a way that will be advantageous to the Government during contract\nperformance.\n \nThe following adjectival ratings/definitions shall be used for the Past Performance evaluation\nfactors:\n \nThere are two aspects to the past performance evaluation. The first is to evaluate the Offerors\npast performance to determine how relevant a recent effort accomplished by the Offeror is to the\neffort to be acquired through the source selection.\n \nWith respect to relevancy, more relevant past performance will typically be a stronger predictor\nof future success and have more influence on the past performance confidence assessment than\npast performance of lesser relevance.\n \n\nPast Performance Relevancy Ratings\n\nRating Definition\n\nRelevant\nPresent/past performance effort involved\nmuch of the magnitude of effort and\ncomplexities this solicitation requires.\n\nNot Relevant\nPresent/past performance effort involved little\nor none of the scope and magnitude of effort\n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 71 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\nand complexities this solicitation requires.\n\n \nThe second aspect of the past performance evaluation is to determine how well the contractor\nperformed on the contracts.\n \nPerformance Confidence Assessment. In conducting a performance confidence assessment, each\nOfferor shall be assigned one of the ratings below:\n \n\nPerformance Confidence Assessments\n\nRating Description\n\nSubstantial Confidence\n\nBased on the Offerors recent/relevant\nperformance record, the Government has a\nhigh expectation that the Offeror will\nsuccessfully perform the required effort.\n\nSatisfactory Confidence\n\nBased on the Offerors recent/relevant\nperformance record, the Government has a\nreasonable expectation that the Offeror will\nsuccessfully perform the required effort.\n\nLimited Confidence\n\nBased on the Offerors recent/relevant\nperformance record, the Government has a\nlow expectation that the Offeror will\nsuccessfully perform the required effort.\n\nNo Confidence\n\nBased on the Offerors recent/relevant\nperformance record, the Government has no\nexpectation that the Offeror will be able to\nsuccessfully perform the required effort.\n\nUnknown Confidence (Neutral)\n\nNo recent/relevant performance record is\navailable or the Offerors performance record\nis so sparse that no meaningful confidence\nassessment rating can be reasonably assigned.\n\n \n \nPerformance Confidence Assessment is an evaluation of the likelihood (or Governments\nconfidence) that the Offeror will successfully perform the solicitations requirements; the\nevaluation is based upon past performance information.\n \nRecency, as it pertains to past performance information, is a measure of the time that has elapsed\nsince the past performance reference occurred. Recency is generally expressed as a time period\nduring which past performance references are considered relevant.\n \n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 72 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\nRelevancy, as it pertains to past performance information, is a measure of the extent of similarity\nbetween the service/support effort, complexity, dollar value, contract type, and\nsubcontract/teaming or other comparable attributes of past performance examples and the source\nsolicitation requirements; and a measure of the likelihood that the past performance is an\nindicator of future performance.\n \n2.2 Description of Evaluation Factors and Subfactors\n \nFactor 1: Technical Capability and Experience\n \nSubfactor A) Technical Capability and Experience\n \nThe Government will evaluate:\n \n- The degree to which the proposal demonstrates specific knowledge, capability and relevant\nexperience to perform the tasks outlined in the Statement of Work sub-task structure.\n \n- The degree to which the proposal demonstrates the Offerors understanding of the\ninterdependencies/inter-relationships of the programs.\n \n- The degree to which the proposal demonstrates the Offerors ability to support PEO IWS 6.0;\nand the Offerors ability to hire and retain personnel capable of meeting current as well as future\nrequirements\n \n- The degree to which the proposal demonstrates unlimited rights in technical data.\n \nSubfactor B) Key Personnel\n \nThe Government will evaluate:\n \n- The degree to which the resumes demonstrate the Offerors knowledge and ability to\nsuccessfully meet requirements of the SOW and related competencies.\n \n- The level of experience performing each of the SOW task area.\n \n- The degree of previous ACAT I, ACAT II and III program experience.\n \n- The degree of personnel relevant education and training.\n \nSubfactor C) Staffing Plan\n \nThe Government will evaluate:\n \n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 73 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\n- The degree to which the Staffing Plan clearly maps to the technical approach and demonstrates\nthat the proposed personnel have the capability to perform the proposed approach.\n \n- The degree to which the qualifications associated with the proposed labor categories\ndemonstrate the ability to successfully meet the requirements of the SOW.\n \n- The degree to which the proposed overall allocation of personnel labor resources demonstrate\nthe Offerors ability to meet the requirements of the SOW.\n \nSubfactor D) Management Plan\n \nThe Government will evaluate:\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan describes how the Offeror intends to manage and\ncoordinate the task efforts of this contract, including planning, assigning responsibility,\ncontrolling personnel, controlling utilization of resources, tracking deliveries, and periodically\nmonitoring performance and obtaining feedback.\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan\'s proposed organizational structure and office\nsystems ensure effectiveness in: (1) interfacing with PEO IWS 6.0 and NAVSEA personnel; and\n(2) Performing and coordinating work.\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan describes the proposed subcontractors or team\nmembers, the planned division on tasks within the team, why the teaming agreements will benefit\nthe Government and aid the contractor in achieving the requirements and objectives of this effort,\nthe management structure for coordinating and controlling subcontractors and/or team members,\nsubcontractor deliveries to the prime and payment tracking, points of contact and the sole bearer\nof ultimate responsibility for performance.\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan describes the procedures in place for monitoring\nand controlling costs and demonstrating that the procedures are successful.\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan addresses the Offeror\'s Transition Plan.\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan describes effective procedures and processes for the\ntransfer and storage of all archived PEO IWS 6.0 programmatic documentation.\n \n- The degree to which the Management Plan delineates adequate measures to coordinate\ncommunications with the incumbent contractor and PEO staff as well as ensure uninterrupted\nworkflow during the transition process.\n \nFactor 2: Past Performance\n \n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 74 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n\nPast performance is a measure of the degree to which the Offeror satisfied its customers in\nprevious relevant contracts and complied with Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. The\nGovernment will evaluate Past Performance Questionnaires and Previous Contract Effort\nNarratives, and may contact some of each Offerors customers to ask whether or not they\nbelieve: (1) that the Offeror is capable, efficient and effective; (2) that the Offerors performance\nconformed to the terms and conditions of its contract; (3) that the Offeror was reasonable and\ncooperative during performance; (4) that the Offeror was committed to customer satisfaction; and\n(5) if given a chance would they select the same or a different Contractor. The Government may\nconsider past performance information obtained from sources other than those identified by the\nOfferor, including Federal, State, and local government agencies, Better Business Bureaus,\npublished media and electronic databases. The lack of recent and relevant past performance\ninformation will result in the assignment of a neutral rating (i.e. neither favorable nor unfavorable)\nfor this factor.\n \nFactor 3: Total Evaluated Cost\n \nThe evaluation will be based on an analysis of the cost realism and completeness of the cost data,\nthe traceability of the cost to the Offerors capability data and the proposed allocation of man-\nhours and labor mix. Pertinent cost information, including but not limited to DCAA\nrecommended rates for such costs as direct labor, overhead, G&A, etc., as necessary and\nappropriate, will be used to arrive at the Government determination of the most probable cost to\nbe incurred in the performance of this contract. If proposed costs are considered to be unrealistic,\nincluding unrealistic labor and indirect rates, the Offerors proposed costs will be adjusted\nupward in accordance with FAR 52.216-10 to reflect more realistic costs. Based on such\nanalysis, an evaluated cost for the Offeror will be calculated to reflect the Governments estimate\nof the Offerors most probable costs. Total evaluated cost to the Government is an Offerors\nevaluated cost (including proposed fee) for the base year and the evaluated cost for all option\nyears. This evaluated cost will be used in making an award recommendation. Therefore, any\ninconsistency, whether real or apparent, between promised performance and cost should be\nexplained in the supporting cost data volume. The burden of proof for cost credibility rests with\nthe Offeror. Offerors are cautioned that to the extent proposed costs appear unrealistic, the\nGovernment may infer either a lack of understanding of the requirements, increased risk of\nperformance, or lack of credibility on the part of the Offeror.\n \nThe Government will evaluate offers for award purposes by adding the evaluated cost for the\nbase periods to the evaluated cost for the option and surge periods. Evaluation of the options will\nnot oblige the Government to exercise the option years or surge option. The Government will\nreview the proposed costs and fee for the option year and surge options for balance and\nreasonableness in comparison with the proposed cost and fees for the base year.\n\n SOLICITATION NO.\n\n N00024-14-R-3495\n AMENDMENT NO.\n\n \n PAGE\n\n 75 of 75\n FINAL\n\n \n\n\n'
