Log:Project Title.
Log:H -60 Helicopter Protective Cover Project Objective.
Log:To provide a single form fitting, H-60 Helicopter protective cover that covers the entire aircraft from nose to tail and provides 100% coverage from sun, rain, dust, dirt, birds, etc.
Log:Technical Features.
Log:The protective cover shall include.
Log: (1) custom fit for Sikorsky
Log:Seahawk model helicopters, i.
Log: SH -60F, HH-60H, MH-60T with transition section tail landing gear, and (2) designed using weatherproof, multi-layered, breathable fabric able to withstand winds of 60 M.
Log: H.
Log:Cover can be manufactured in multiple sections, but must cover the entire aircraft fuselage when installed.
Log:The protective cover will be installed for transporting and during extended periods of outside storage where the aircraft is vulnerable to the environment.
Log:Required technical features.
Log: Form -fitted for entire aircraft coverage (nose to tail) configured as follows.
Log: Main rotor blades removed.
Log: Main gearbox and main rotor head installed.
Log: Tail rotor blades removed.
